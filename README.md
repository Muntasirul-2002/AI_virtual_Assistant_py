# AI_virtual_Assistant_py
I created a personal AI virtual assistant which uses voice as a commends to do my daily task like opening websites, playing music and much more

This repository contains the code for an AI virtual assistant that I created using Python. The assistant is able to perform a variety of tasks, including:
~ Opening applications
~ Playing music
~ Searching the web
~ Setting reminders
~ Getting news updates
~ Providing weather information
~ And more!

The assistant is still under development, but I am constantly adding new features and improving its performance. I hope that you will find it useful and that you will contribute to its development.

I am always open to feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have any ideas for how to improve the assistant.

Thank you for checking out my project!
